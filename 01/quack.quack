HW#01 -- ...We Go!

I think the most riveting part of my ducky's and my adventure from last year is trying to get through the different sorts in APCS Term 1. I personally found the
topic of sorting the most difficult to understand during APCS01 and I had to use my ducky as well as my classmates sometimes to try to explain what I think I know
the the best of my ability so that I can solidify the way I understand the different sorts. After a few homework assignments using the different sorts and using
the QAF to find videos that better explain sorting, I explained my solidified idea of sorting to my ducky until eventually I was comfortable with the topic.
